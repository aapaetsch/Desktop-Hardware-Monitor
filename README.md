# Desktop-Hardware-Monitor
A desktop hardware monitor built with Electron and React. 
Also will use a C# console application running the LibreHardwareMonitor library to retrieve the current stats from the host computer.
- Originally planned to use OpenHardwareMonitor but it currently has issues retrieving information from AMD Cpu's and GPU's.

LibreHardwareMonitor Github Project can be found [here](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor).
